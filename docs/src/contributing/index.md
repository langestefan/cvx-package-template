There are many ways you can contribute to repository, and we welcome all help!
Here are some ideas (of varying difficulty):

* Answer an open `GitHub issue <https://github.com/cvxgrp/<repository>/issues>`_
* Improve the documentation (the website or in the code)
* Add more :ref:`examples` to the docs
* Improve the test coverage

If you are interested in helping out, please start by opening a
[GitHub issue](https://github.com/cvxgrp/<repository>/issues) so we can track progress
and ensure that our priorities align.
